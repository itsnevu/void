## Client -> server: the player pressed Recall (the B keybind). Start the recall
## channel - a 5s rooted cast that teleports to the town hub on completion and
## cancels on move (the shared channel root) or damage (cancel_on_damage). The
## channel machinery (push, root, cast bar, cancel) is all reused from the aura;
## recall just rides it with a town-travel payoff. No cooldown - re-press anytime.
