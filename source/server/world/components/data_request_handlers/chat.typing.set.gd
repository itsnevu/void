extends DataRequestHandler
## Broadcasts a per-player "is typing" flag to everyone in the sender's
## instance. Triggered by focus_entered / focus_exited on the chat input -
## at most two packets per typing session, regardless of how many keystrokes
## the user actually produces.
##
## Scope is intentionally the whole instance (matches the world-chat
## proximity model). Block list is respected so a recipient who blocked the
## sender doesn't see their typing indicator either.
