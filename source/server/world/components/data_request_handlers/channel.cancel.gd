## Client -> server: the caster moved (or otherwise wants out), so stop their
## active channel. ChannelInstance.cancel() pushes channel.end itself, which
## clears the aura on every client and the root on the caster's. No-op if the
## player has no channel running (a stale cancel after it already ended).
