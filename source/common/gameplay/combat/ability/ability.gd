## Base of every weapon action. There is deliberately NO "basic attack vs
## ability" split — a basic attack is just an ability with mana_cost 0. That
## one rule keeps the whole layer uniform: ABILITY_HASTE shortens every
## cooldown (it IS attack speed for basics and cooldown reduction for
## specials), and mana only gates the actions that declare a cost.


@export var name: String
## HUD art (ability bar tile, future tooltips). Null = the bar shows the
## ability's initials instead, so missing art degrades gracefully.
@export var icon: Texture2D
@export var cooldown: float = 1.0
## Mana cost. 0 = free (basic attacks). Checked in can_use (client predicts with
## its synced mana; server is authoritative) and consumed server-side by the
## weapon right after use.
@export var mana_cost: int = 0
## Stamina cost (the physical counterpart of mana_cost). 0 = free. Use this on
## melee/ranged abilities so martial kits spend ENERGY while casters spend MANA.
## An ability should set ONE of mana_cost / stamina_cost, not both.

## --- Combat juice (read by weapon visuals like the hammer slam) ---
## Camera kick for the WIELDER when this lands (0 none … ~0.3 light, ~0.9 huge).

## Shockwave ring / flash tint. Warm gold by default; a heavy T3 can run hotter.

## Roots the wielder's MOVEMENT this long while performing (commit to the
## swing — heavier attacks plant you harder). 0 = free to move. Client-side,
## reusing the movement lock; long weapon cooldowns mean it never feels sticky.
@export var root_s: float = 0.0

## Wind-up before the hit lands (a telegraphed heavy ability). 0 = instant.
## During the cast a danger telegraph fills, the wielder is rooted (set root_s
## to match), and the DAMAGE is delayed to land with the visual — so targets
## can step out of the zone. Read by MeleeSwingAbility (delay + telegraph) and
## the weapon visual (wind-up length).

## Two-phase abilities (charge weapons) set this true in _init: use_ability is

## applies cooldown + mana on the completing phase only. Single-phase abilities
## leave it false and everything behaves as before.
