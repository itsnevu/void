class_name Firefly
extends Node2D
## A drifting glow that casts real light - for night forests / dark glades / caves. Place
## one or a cluster in a map; each gently wanders around its placed position and softly
## pulses, so a group reads as fireflies. Purely cosmetic + client-side: it self-frees on a
## headless server. It doesn't need the day/night tint to exist, but it only READS as light
## against a dark ambient - so it shines in dark maps / at night, and washes out in daylight.

## How far it drifts from its placed position (px).
@export var wander_radius: float = 24.0
## Drift speed multiplier.
@export var wander_speed: float = 0.6
## Light-brightness pulse: speed (rad/s) and depth (fraction of the base energy).
@export var pulse_speed: float = 2.0
@export var pulse_amount: float = 0.25
