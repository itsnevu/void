class_name PlayerSkins
## Thin facade over the `sprites` ContentRegistry: every sprite is a wearable player skin.
## Character creation (gateway), the wardrobe, and the server's buy/equip validation all go
## through here so they agree on the roster + display names WITHOUT a hardcoded list - drop a
## SpriteFrames into the sprite_frames folder, reindex, and it's offered everywhere at once.


## All skin ids, sorted ascending (so the original starters lead) - every entry in the
## `sprites` registry. Used by the wardrobe + character creation to list buyable skins.
static func ids() -> Array[int]:
	var registry: ContentRegistry = ContentRegistryHub.registry_of(&"sprites")

	var out: Array[int] = registry.all_ids()

## True when [param skin_id] resolves to a real sprite. Server-side anti-cheat: stops a
## client buying/equipping an id that doesn't exist in the registry.

## empty string if the id isn't in the registry.
