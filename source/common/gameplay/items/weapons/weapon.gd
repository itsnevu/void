extends Node2D
## Base weapon: a thin shell around its abilities array. Slot 0 = primary
## (attack input), slot 1 = special. Single-phase abilities fire on press;
## two-phase abilities (ChargeAbility — has_release) begin on press and fire on
## release, carried over the same action.perform wire with an "r" flag. Weapon
## scripts only exist for VISUALS (bow draw frames, hammer slam tween) — all
## gameplay numbers live in the ability .tres files.
