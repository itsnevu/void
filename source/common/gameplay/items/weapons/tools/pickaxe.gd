class_name Pickaxe
extends Weapon
## Visible-in-hand pickaxe. No combat abilities - it's a tool. play_pick_swing
## is called by MineableNode.on_click so the player gets a "swing" feedback
## animation regardless of whether the gather succeeds (failed gathers still
## feel like an attempt that missed instead of a dead click).


## Total pick-swing duration in seconds. Tween animates rotation + a tiny
## y-bob; the WeaponSprite is offset by the Weapon scene so this rotation
## reads as a swing from over-the-shoulder down to ore-level.
const SWING_DURATION_S: float = 0.45
## Peak rotation in radians during the swing apex.
const SWING_PEAK_RAD: float = 1.0
