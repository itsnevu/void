class_name HealBolt
extends Projectile
## A bolt that heals the first ALLY it touches instead of damaging enemies. Ally = spar teammate
## (while either side is in a match), otherwise a guildmate / groupmate - the same definition the
## team-colored health bars use. Everyone else (enemies, neutral players, NPCs) it flies straight
## through; walls stop it.
##
## Only overrides the per-hit RESPONSE - the Projectile base owns all detection, walls and piercing.
## Server-authoritative: only the server bolt applies the heal (+ broadcasts the green number);
## client bolts stop on the first ally so the flight reads naturally.

var heal_amount: float = 0.0


## Heal the first allied player crossed; pass non-allies; stop on solid geometry.

## Green floating "+N" over the healed ally, for everyone in the instance - same combat.hit path
## weapon damage and flag repairs use. Naming ServerInstance here is safe on client exports thanks
## to the stub-generating export plugin (addons/tinymmo/export_plugin/export_plugin.gd).
