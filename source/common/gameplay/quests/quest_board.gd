class_name QuestBoard
extends Interactable
## A clickable town board posting the player's 3 daily quests - shown as a board
## sprite. Just an Interactable preconfigured to open the daily board; the click is
## inherited. One per map suffices (daily state is per-player, not per-board). No
## id/range needed - it opens the caller's OWN dailies, not a station's state.

	menu_name = &"daily_board"
