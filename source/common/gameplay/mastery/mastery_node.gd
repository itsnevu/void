class_name MasteryNode
extends Resource
## One unlockable entry in a weapon category's mastery tree. Two kinds:
## - ABILITY node: [member ability] is set - owning it lets the player mount
##   that ability in the weapon's special slot (their loadout pick).
## - PASSIVE node: [member ability] is null - its [member passive_modifiers]
##   apply to live stats while a weapon of the tree's category is wielded.
## Point cost and special-slot weight both equal [member tier] (one number,
## no drift - see docs/mastery.md).

## Tile art for the skill-tree node. Falls back to the ability's own icon
## (ABILITY nodes carry one), then the node's initials - so missing art degrades
## gracefully. Drop a ~26x26 pixel icon here; PixelIcon integer-scales it crisp.

@export_multiline var description: String
## &"offensive", &"defensive" or &"supportive" - pure UI grouping.
@export var branch: StringName = &"offensive"
## 1-3. Doubles as point cost AND ability weight (the weapon-capacity gate).

## Upgrade chain: the id of the lower-tier node this one REPLACES (empty = a
## standalone ability or the chain's root). A "signature move" is a chain - you
## must own the lower tier to learn the next, you can't equip two tiers of the
## same chain, and an equipped slot always resolves to your HIGHEST owned tier.
## See docs/mastery.md and MasteryService chain helpers.
