## Workflow: create instances under res://source/common/gameplay/shops/data/,
## then run the TinyMMO plugin's Generate with content_name "shops" pointing at
## that folder. The plugin assigns each shop a registry id/slug (baked into
## metadata) and builds shops_index.tres, so shops resolve through
## ContentRegistryHub like items and maps - sent over the network as a small id.

## Which trades this shop offers the player (controls which tabs the shop UI shows).
