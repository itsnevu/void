class_name DungeonExit
extends Interactable
## A "leave the dungeon" station - place it at the entrance/spawn (where players
## respawn on death). Click -> the dungeon-exit confirm (-> recall to town, drop from
## the run). Just an Interactable preconfigured with its menu; the click plumbing is
## inherited. (Recall works as the universal escape too; this is the obvious one.)
