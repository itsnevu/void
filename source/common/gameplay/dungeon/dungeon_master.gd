class_name DungeonMaster
extends Area2D
## LEGACY dungeon station. The NEW, meaningful way to offer a dungeon is a
## dungeon-keeper NPC with a DungeonInteraction (a real character) - see
## DungeonInteraction. This node is kept so existing entrance scenes keep working:
## it holds the dungeon and opens the lobby identified by its own NODE NAME (no
## manual id; the server resolves the station by name + range-checks its position).
##
## Setup: place as a direct child of a Map with a CollisionShape2D (the click
## target) and assign the [member dungeon]. Its position is the lobby anchor.

## The dungeon this station runs.
