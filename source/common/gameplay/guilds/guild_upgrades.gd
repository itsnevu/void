## Catalog + effect resolvers for Guild Hall upgrades. Pure/static - the only
## per-guild state is `Guild.upgrades` (upgrade_id -> level). Every perk here is
## HORIZONTAL (capacity / economy QoL / cosmetic), never combat power or faster
## progression - see the fair-perks principle in docs/guild.md.
